# zerg-rush
This is a **result of a workshop app** created for my course on TypeScript. 
Sources are written in TypeScript but this repo contains only build result. 
App targets ES6+ browsers and it is hosted as a GitHub Page.

**Theme**: Google's minigame Zerg Rush. Defend your Cargo and kill all Zergs!

You can [try it yourself](https://ecl1ps.github.io/zerg-rush/)!

_* Visual aspects of the game are intentionally as simple as possible so don't expect fancy visuals._
